//Description: A python 2.7 implementation of gcForest proposed in [1]. A demo implementation of gcForest library as well as some demo client scripts to demostrate how to use the code. The implementation is flexible enough for modifying the model or
//fit your own datasets. 
//Reference: [1] Z.-H. Zhou and J. Feng. Deep Forest: Towards an Alternative to Deep Neural Networks. In IJCAI-2017.  (https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08835v2 )
//Requirements: This package is developed with Python 2.7, please make sure all the demendencies are installed, which is specified in requirements.txt
//ATTN: This package is free for academic usage. You can run it at your own risk. For other purposes, please contact Prof. Zhi-Hua Zhou(zhouzh@lamda.nju.edu.cn)
//ATTN2: This package was developed by Mr.Ji Feng(fengj@lamda.nju.edu.cn). The readme file and demo roughly explains how to use the codes. For any problem concerning the codes, please feel free to contact Mr.Feng.
